Using NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) satellite to track worldwide volcanic activity.

Volcano eruptions go through eruptive phases that can last from a day to years. During these phases, there are moments where the volcano does not show any activity.

The DSCOVR satellite was launched on 2015 by SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and it's constantly taking photos of our blue marble.

The idea of this project was to use NASA's EPIC API and volcano eruption data to find the available images from the satellite for those specific dates.

The resulting images will still be hosted at the NASA archive.
